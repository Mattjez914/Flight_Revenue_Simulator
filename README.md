# Flight_Revenue_Simulator (FRS)

There are 4 scenarios. 
1) 100 day 100 ticket
2) 14 day 50 ticket
3) 2 day 20 ticket
1) 1 day 3 ticket

We are trying to optimize the pricing function
We are given a demand and the number of tickets left each day.

The number of tickets sold is = demand - price = # tickets sold

The folders labeled 'line#' have a csv and matplotlib graphs of the 
distributions of the coefficients by scenario.
